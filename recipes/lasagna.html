        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This recipe is not exactly ideal to look at and salivate over in
            a month that we are all on our low carb, Keto, paleo, weight watchers,
            cabbage soup, low fat, low carb, rabbit food diets. But…It’s Lasagna.
            And I DO know that many of us still have to cook ‘normal’ foods for our
            families.

            My mama’s famous lasagna recipe is hands down the best lasagna I have
            ever had in my life. She learnt her ways from her Italian friends when
            she lived in New York City, adjusting the recipe through the years to
            perfect it…and every single person that tries her recipe comes back for
            seconds, thirds and leftovers for the next day!
