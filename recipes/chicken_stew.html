        <p>
            Properly browning your chicken pieces in the pot before adding liquid helps to create delicious
            extra depth of flavour in a stew. When you add the water, scrape the bottom of the pan with a
            wooden spoon to loosen the sticky brown bits so they can help flavour the gravy.
